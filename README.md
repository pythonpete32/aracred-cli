# Aracred CLI

Aracred CLI runs SourceCred on a Discorse server, and mints the cred on chain in an Aragon DAO

## Deployment

Clone the SourceCred Repo and install deps

    git clone https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred.git && cd sourcecred && npm i

install the aragonCLI globally. If you have trouble installing the cli, check out [this guide](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/guides-faq)

    npm i -g @aragon/cli

clone this repo and install deps

    git clone https://github.com/pythonpete32/aracred-cli/ && cd aracred && npm i

create a `secret.js` file in the root directory and add the following with your github token

    `export default "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE";`

build the project 

    npm prepublish

link the package so it can be refrenced globaly

    npm link

## Creating Labels

Navigate back to the SourceCred folder and type `aracred` into the terminal. This will create `toMint.csv` and `addresses.csv` files. Edit `addresses.csv` to add user's addresses and use `aracred addresses` to obtain a new `addresses.json` file that can be uploaded as local labels in Aragon Client.

## Development Commands

```sh
$ npm test # run tests with Jest
$ npm run coverage # run tests with coverage and open it on browser
$ npm run lint # lint code
$ npm run docs # generate docs
$ npm run build # generate docs and transpile code
```

### Publish

```sh
$ npm release
$ npm publish
```

It'll automatically run `test`, `lint`, `docs`, `build`, generate `CHANGELOG.md`, and push commits and tags to the remote repository.
